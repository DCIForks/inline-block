# Side-by-side `div`s with `inline-block`

**Warning: your browser will consider any space between a closing tag and an opening tag as white space, and place a single "space" character between your images. To prevent this from happening, place the final `>` of the closing `</div>` tag right next to the initial `<` of the following `<div>` opening tag.**

```html
      ...
       <p>Dog's paw</p>
     </div
    ><div>
      <img src="img/nails.jpg" alt="hand" />
      ...
```
